    Overview:

        Shader program 'standard':
            Get shader desc: standard_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: standard_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_standard_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_standard_vs_uv0 = 1
                Uniform block 'StandardUniforms':
                    C struct: StandardUniforms_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_StandardUniforms = 0
            Fragment shader: standard_fs
                Image 'the_texture':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_the_texture = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader standard = sg_make_shader(standard_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'standard_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_standard_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_standard_vs_uv0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_the_texture = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'StandardUniforms':

        StandardUniforms_t StandardUniforms = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_StandardUniforms, &SG_RANGE(StandardUniforms));
