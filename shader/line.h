    Overview:

        Shader program 'line':
            Get shader desc: line_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: line_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_line_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_line_vs_color0 = 1
                Uniform block 'LineUniforms':
                    C struct: LineUniforms_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_LineUniforms = 0
            Fragment shader: line_fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader line = sg_make_shader(line_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'line_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_line_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_line_vs_color0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'LineUniforms':

        LineUniforms_t LineUniforms = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_LineUniforms, &SG_RANGE(LineUniforms));
